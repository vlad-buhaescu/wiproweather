# wiproweather

How to run the app:

1. Open .xcworkspace project
2. App will start with London as firct city to display wheather forecast
3. You can either swipe inside the map and than click the "Get wheather here" button or
4. Type the name of the city that you want to see the forecast
5. The result from OpenWheather are displayed in a horizontal, paginated collection view, where I include information in the metric format such as mean, min, max temperature, humidity, a short string description, humidity and a cloud icon

Building is intuitive using the play button in Xcode.

I wrote some small Unit Tests.

What I would do with more time:

1. Write extensive UI and Unit tests.
2. Investigate the app with Intruments
3. Add autocompletion for city names.
4. Refine the UI to be clearer.
